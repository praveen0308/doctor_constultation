  static const String fact1 = 'The nature of this material world is such that every living entity has to undergo the cycle of birth, disease, old age and death. With Homeopathy all diseases in their curable stage is curable and I personally with my experience still uphold that the physician fails but not Homeopathy in curable cases.';

  static const String fact3 = "Not always. Only in few diseases and that's too does not increase suffering as with the action of cure comes a feeling of well being and even in that aggravation of symptoms the patients feels good. It's a subtle feeling and can only be experienced if you have been under Homeopathic treatment. Under a expert Homeopath that aggravation may be very minute or nil but anyways it's not dangerous.";
  static const String fact4 = "Very funny indeed, if that would have been possible then the pharmaceutical companies would not have silently sit and watch. It's absurd and stupid to even think so.";
  static const String fact5 = "Depends upon the disease condition. In few cases like headache, flu, diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, food poisoning etc. It's fastest than any medicine known to mankind, act's in fraction of seconds. In few chronic cases it's slow, obviously because a lot of work needs to be done internally before showing the result on surface.";

She listened to me very patiently, took proper history and diagnosed my problem very quickly. She gave me three doses of  the appropriate medicine and after that I was surprised that my knee pain was completely cured. It had taken my doctor about 6 months trying to help me from this complaint but without success I was suffering till I was treated by Dr Yaduvanshi. I would not hesitate to recommend her and since then have taken all the treatments if needed by her and am still under her care and guidance.';
